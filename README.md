# Keras model deploying with Java

Starting from another project I built to classify images using Keras (https://github.com/marcogdepinto/ScenarioClassifier), I worked on deepening my Java knowledge creating a class to consume the model already trained in Python.

The library used is [DeepLearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/).

# Output example

```
[city, desert, mountain, nature, sea, universe]
[[    1.0000,         0,         0,         0,         0,         0]]
[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
city
```
